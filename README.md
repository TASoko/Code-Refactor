# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

Project: A marketing agency wants a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that their site is optimized for search engines.

In this repository resides the first homework on code refactoring. The files written were edited and fixed from the inital starting code given to the class. The code has been improved for accessability, following the required standards, as well as SEO. Accessability improved and is now 95% according the Google Lighthouse. The SEO has improved to 100% by the same metric.

The code required fine tuning on both the index.html and style.css files. In regards to the index.html, semantic elements were added in the form of the header element, a description was added to the head using a meta tag, the h2 in the footer was removed and an id tag was added to make all the links work. 

In the style.css file elements had to be renamed/corrected due to the change in the html document. There were several elements that had the same properties and were thus grouped together for better legibility. And lastly, due to the removal of the footer heading the corresponding css element was deleted.
